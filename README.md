![Travis CI build status](https://travis-ci.org/blundin/zettelgartner.svg?branch=master)

Zettelgartner is a made-up German name for a lightweight, node.js-based Zettelkasten maintenance utility.

## Pre-release software

The code in this repository is not complete, and really shouldn't be used yet. Mainly because it's not yet useful. However, I've found it can be useful to do my work in public. So, here it is.

## What it is Zettelgartner?

Zettelgartner is a made-up German name for a lightweight, node.js-based [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de) maintenance utility.

## Features

### Backlinks

This feature is inspired by the more elegant [note-link-janitor](https://github.com/andymatuschak/note-link-janitor) by Andy Matuschak, and my desire to bring backlinks to my Zettelkasten after trying out [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

When executed, Zettelgartner will scan all markdown notes for wiki-style links, and will append a block of backlinks to each note.

### Tag summary notes



### Hyperlink reports and maintenance
